# Influenza Season Plan


The goal of this project was to help a medical staffing agency that provides temporary workers to clinics and hospitals on an as-needed basis. The analysis should help plan for the upcoming Influenza season, as additional staff will be in high demand at that time. The main objectives of this analysis are:

- Does Influenza occur seasonally or throughout the year? If seasonal, what month does it start/end?
- Assess data limitations that may prevent you from conducting your desired analysis.
- Prioritize states with larger vulnerable populations.
- Provide a plan for the staffing agency.

  There is no data for the number of staff each hospital has/recieves. This interferes with the analysis because if this data were given, a more concise plan could be formed.

 - Then **most vulnerable populations** are elderly people, specifically those 85 and older. Tableau shows that states like New York and California not only lead the nation in total deaths, but deaths of those elderly individuals. This could mean that states with larger populations experience more Influenza related deaths.

   - The R2 score of 0.92 as well as the scatterplot show a strong correlation between population size and Influenza death rate. 
   
   
   <ins>**Summary/Plan:**<ins/>
    
 Influenza occurs seasonally, starting in October and ending in March. States with larger populations experience a higher death count than those with smaller populations. The most vulnerable age groups are the elderly, specifically those 85 and older. States like Texas, New York and California lead the nation in total Influenza deaths. 
 
  **<ins>Plan:<ins/>**
     
   **The agency should allocate more staff to more populated states, especially states that record high death rates for the elderly (e.g. Texas, California). The agency should also be mindful to increase their staff during the Influenza season (October - March).**
