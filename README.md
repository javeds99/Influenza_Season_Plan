# Influenza Season Plan

The goal of this project was to help a medical staffing agency that provides temporary workers to clinics and hospitals on an as-needed basis. The analysis should help plan for the upcoming Influenza season, as additional staff will be in high demand at that time. The agency also covers all hospitals in each of the 50 states of the United States. This project uses historical data from 2009-2013 that records Influenza deaths in all 50 states, as well as a dataset that records the population of each state, by age, every year from 2009-2017. This project was designed to build upon my Excel skills, as well as introduce me to Tableau.
