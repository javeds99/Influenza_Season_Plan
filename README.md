# Influenza Season Plan


The goal of this project was to help a medical staffing agency that provides temporary workers to clinics and hospitals on an as-needed basis. The analysis should help plan for the upcoming Influenza season, as additional staff will be in high demand at that time. The main objectives of this analysis are:

- Does Influenza occur seasonally or throughout the year? If seasonal, what month does it start/end?
- Assess data limitations that may prevent you from conducting your desired analysis.
- Prioritize states with larger vulnerable populations.
- Provide a plan for the staffing agency.

There is no data for the number of staff each hospital has/recieves. This interferes with the analysis because if this data were given, a more concise plan could be formed.
